Process Blog - Workout Calendar/Tracker

The goal of this project is to track my workouts througout the current month. 

Process:
For the sake of this project I simply added my December workouts into the DynamoDB database and then exported to a json file. A result of the AWS problems and the weeklong flu I had in the weeks before the final projects, I think that is a good way to both use the DynamoDB and have a working visualization. I also manipulated the json file a bit so it would fit better in the html table essentially.

Using a simple Calendar html/Css design I use the data to display my workouts in this month so far.
